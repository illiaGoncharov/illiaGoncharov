# Illia Goncharov  

I build systems and interfaces that stay clear and reliable even when requirements change.  
I like when code is simple to read, easy to maintain, and the architecture makes sense.  

I usually work with **TypeScript/React** on the frontend and **Node.js** on the backend.  
Testing is part of the process, not an afterthought.  

For me, a project is a product: something that should work not only for today’s deadline but also in the long run.
